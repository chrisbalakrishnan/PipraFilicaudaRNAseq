This repository contains scripts used in the anlysis of RNA-seq data
from the manakin Pipra filicauda.

The development of this work was facilitated by a NSF Research
Coordination Network grant (1457541, PI: Bette Loiselle).

Funding for this work was provided by NSF 1353085 (Brandt Ryder, Ignacio
Moore & Brent Horton) & 1456612 (Chris Balakrishnan)

Raw RNAseq data can be found at NCBI (PRJNA437157) and the reference
genome used was Manacus vitellinus (ASM171598v1)
